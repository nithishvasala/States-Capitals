The purpose of the project

Usually, I have curiosity to know each and every state and it's capital and mostly what is famous for, but the problem is i have to search it and memorize it.
Here i wanted to access it quick, so i have created project in shell scripting.
It hardly took me 2 days.

I have created it very properly and systematic way, so who ever using this project will not face any problem in understanding.

I have created many projects and uploaded on drives and social networks to improve my project management and I assume it will definately help to reach my future goals.

I am currently working in Networking Field in MNC company.

I will post more projects on peoples demand.
